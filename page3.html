    <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Sayok Bose. I am a rising senior at Elkins Highschool. At Elkins, I am a part of many clubs and remain active as an student. I am a Pratham Activities officer. 
    I am responsible for working with my partner to create activities to raise awareness for the education disparity in India. These activites range from helping to organize speaker events, socials and creating schedules to make sure everything stays on time.
    I also help with fundraisers, Walk-a-thons and more. I am a officer in our school's debate team. I do varsity public forum. I have reached the semifinals at the Dulles Highschool tournament and Dobie Highschool. I qualified for state my sophomore year, and went to El Paso last year to compete on the state level. This year my partner and I won the Clearbrook Tournament. Participating every weekend has forced me to acquire time management skills as debate requires extreme dedication because I spend around 12 hours just practicing for debate, and then each tournament takes up 2 days. I qualified for state 2 years in a row, competed at the Global Tournament of Champions, and am ranked top 12% in the nation. 

    </p>
    <p>I am a part of Elkin's National Honor Society meaning that I volunteer every month. Furthermore, I got chosen  to be a speaker at FBISD Convocation in 2019.
      I spoke in front of 300+ teachers from all over FBISD and had to give a speech to motivate them. Academically, I have an unweighted GPA of a 3.98 and a weighted GPA of a 4.6. I am in the top 4% of my class. Furthermore, I also got a 1570 on my SAT.
